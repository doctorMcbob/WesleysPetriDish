The following is a verbose editor for playing with Cellular Automata in N dimensions.

in the application, there are `cubes` and `frames`

push `c` to create a new cube
push `f` to create a new frame

once a frame is created, mouse over to select the context of the frame

while a frame is selected, press `SHIFT` and a `DIRECTIONAL BUTTON` to swap the AXIS you are graphing the cube through

a frame has a cube, two graph axis, and an index axis.

Look, I know this doesnt make sense. I'm going re write this later when more ideas are finalized.
